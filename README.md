Big Data subjects first lab work


############################################## ----------------------------------- Scripts
Code_lab1.py
This script compares the performance of parallelized tasks versus non-parallelized tasks on a subsample of data. It demonstrates the impact of parallelization on task execution time.
Key Focus: Performance comparison (parallelized vs. non-parallelized)
Data: Subsample of the dataset

Code_lab1_2.py
This script evaluates the performance of parallelized tasks using varying numbers of CPUs and chunk sizes on the full dataset. The goal is to assess how different configurations of parallelization impact execution time.
Key Focus: Performance comparison with different CPU counts and chunk sizes
Data: Full dataset
